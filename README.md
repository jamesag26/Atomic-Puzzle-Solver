# Atomic-Puzzle-Solver
For this assignment we had to create a solver for a randomized state of the atomic chaos puzzle. This solver relied on the iterative deepening A-star algorithm to find a solution. It used a heuristic and cost value to determine the best path to take to solve the puzzle. The heuristic and cost value are described in further detail in the AIreport2.pdf file provided in this project. The report also goes in depth to explain an error in the program when running the solver multiple times in a row. (Link to explanation of puzzle: https://www.jaapsch.net/puzzles/chaos.htm)
The files provided are the files for the randomizer which was provided by a fellow classmate named Lydia Brothers, the heuristic value calculator files for decision making, the file for making the puzzle moves to go into the next state and finally the main file which is responsible for running the program. Also provided is a pdf report file which goes further in depth into problems I had with the program, explanation behind certain design decisions and an overview on the results from testing the program.
